# Teacher Actions for Ongoing Tests

This document outlines the actions a teacher can perform on tests that are currently in the "Ongoing" tab within the Test Management dashboard.

## Individual Test Actions

When clicking the three-dots menu icon for a single ongoing test, a teacher has the following options:

1.  **View Questions**:
    *   **Action**: Opens the question editor in a read-only mode.
    *   **Purpose**: Allows the teacher to review the questions and options for the live test without being able to make changes.

2.  **Revert to Draft**:
    *   **Action**: Moves the test from the "Ongoing" state back to the "Drafts" tab.
    *   **Warning**: This is a destructive action. It will **delete all existing student submissions and test sessions** for this test. The test will need to be published again for students to take it.
    *   **Purpose**: Use this if a major error is found in the test after it has been published and you need to make significant edits before re-issuing it.

3.  **View Results**:
    *   **Action**: Navigates to the Test Results page for the ongoing test.
    *   **Purpose**: Allows the teacher to monitor student progress in real-time. On this page, the teacher can see which students have started or completed the test, view their current scores, and **reset an individual student's test session** if needed.

4.  **End Quiz**:
    *   **Action**: Immediately stops the test for all students and moves it to the "Completed" tab.
    *   **Warning**: This action cannot be undone.
    *   **Purpose**: Use this to manually end a test before its scheduled end time.

## Bulk Actions

When one or more ongoing tests are selected using the checkboxes, a teacher can perform the following actions in bulk:

1.  **Revert to Draft**:
    *   **Action**: Moves all selected ongoing tests back to the "Drafts" tab, deleting all associated student sessions.

2.  **End Now**:
    *   **Action**: Immediately ends all selected tests and moves them to the "Completed" tab.
